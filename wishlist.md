1) &#10004; Arbitrary crop area, selectable by click and drag in the preview.
2) &#10004;The crop box should be shown in the preview in a distinct highlight color and have grab & drag corners and edges to adjust it
3) &#10004;The crop corner locations (X & Y) should be shown in editable text fields for manual fine adjustment
4) &#10004;There should be an image scaling editable text field
5) &#10004;Upscaling should be allowed up to some reasonable limit
6) &#10004;A related simple feature is flip, as in flip vertical and flip horizontal checkboxes on the preprocessing tab.

1) Add in ability to generate mp4 or some other movie format. Perhaps using what Cor had been fiddling with: calling external programs like ffmpeg.
2) Adding the ability to call external programs actually frees up a lot of the WS effort. For example, cropping, image, conversions to jpeg etc are easily done with imagemagick. Also, applying a mask file in batch - MPO
