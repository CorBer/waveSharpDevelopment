<b>TAN</b>

1) Add in ability to generate mp4 or some other movie format. Perhaps using what Cor had been fiddling with: calling external programs like ffmpeg.
2) Adding the ability to call external programs actually frees up a lot of the WS effort. For example, cropping, image, conversions to jpeg etc are easily done with imagemagick. Also, applying a mask file in batch - MPO
